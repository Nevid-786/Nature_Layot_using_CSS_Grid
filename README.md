## 🎯 Overview

This project is a personal portfolio website created to demonstrate strong understanding of HTML5, CSS3 (CSS Grid & Flexbox), responsive design, and aesthetic layout. It emphasizes visual presentation, organization, and smooth user experience.

## 🧰 Features

- **CSS Grid Layout** — for arranging project sections, gallery, or work showcase in a flexible, responsive grid.  
- **Flexbox** — for aligning header, navigation, footer, and other components.  
- **Responsive Design** — the layout adjusts across various screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).  
- **Clean UI/UX** — minimal design with thoughtful whitespace, typography, and color palette.  
- **Hover / Interaction Effects** — subtle transitions or hover effects to make interaction feel smooth.

---


- `index.html` — main HTML file.  
- `css/` — styles separated, Grid-specific stylesheet (if any) for clarity.  
- `assets/` — images, icons, other static resources.
